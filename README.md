# Background

I am using this project as a chance to get some first time hands on experience with the Laravel framework and PHP language. In creating this I referenced the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation) and [this tutorial](https://laravel-news.com/your-first-laravel-application). It was really fun to start learning a new framework and language from scratch after getting more confident with the technologies I learned in the Momentum fullstack development program!
